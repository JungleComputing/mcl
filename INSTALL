			     INSTALLING MCL
			    ________________





1 Introduction
==============

  Most of MCL's source is contained in literal programming Org-mode
  files with extension ".org".  This document only describes the initial
  part of extracting the actual sources from the literate programming
  files, a process that is called 'tangling'.  From there we generate
  HTML pages with the full instructions.


2 Prerequisites
===============

  We need the following software: `git', `emacs' version 25 or higher,
  and a sufficiently compatible shell such as `bash'.  In addition, we
  need the package `org-build-tools' that we retrieve with `git'.


3 Obtaining org-build-tools
===========================

  The package `org-build-tools' is needed by MCL, but is in principle
  independent of `MCL'.  It is therefore possible to place it in a
  non-intrusive way, for example in `$HOME/.mcl_util/'.  For the rest of
  this document we assume that this is the directory to store the
  utilities.

  We can retrieve org-build-tools with:

  ,----
  | mkdir ~/.mcl_util
  | cd ~/.mcl_util
  | git clone https://github.com/JungleComputing/org-build-tools.git
  `----

  We need to create the environment variable `ORG_BUILD_TOOLS' for
  installing MCL, so in your shell initialization script (for example
  `.bashrc') add:

  ,----
  | export ORG_BUILD_TOOLS=$HOME/.mcl_util/org-build-tools
  `----

  Restart the shell our perform:

  ,----
  | source ~/.bashrc
  `----


4 Obtaining MCL
===============

  We can retrieve MCL with:

  ,----
  | git clone https://github.com/JungleComputing/mcl.git
  `----

  We can now retrieve all the submodules:

  ,----
  | cd mcl
  | 
  | git submodule init
  | git submodule update
  `----

  To be able to create the documentation for MCL, the scripts need to
  know the location of the root directory of MCL.  We can set this
  variable by adding the following to the shell initialization script
  (for example `/.bashrc'):

  ,----
  | export MCL_ROOT_DIR=/path/to/mcl
  `----

  Then load the initialization script:

  ,----
  | source ~/.bashrc
  `----


5 Tangling MCL
==============

  From the MCL root directory we can tangle all the `.org' files.  These
  scripts make use of `org-build-tools'.

  ,----
  | ./scripts/tangle-mcl
  `----


6 Generate the documentation
============================

  The overall installation documentation is described in
  `doc/installing_mcl.org' which is an ASCII file and is legible with
  any editor.  However, it is also possible to create documentation in
  the form of HTML pages with the command:

  ,----
  | ./scripts/export-to-html-mcl
  `----

  The file `doc/index.html' will refer you to the full installation
  process.
