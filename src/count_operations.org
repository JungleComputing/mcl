* Count operations

In this micro-pass we are going to count the operations of a kernel.  We make a
distiction between three types of operations: compute operations, memory
operations, and overhead operations.  Compute operations contribute to the
result that is computed by the kernel, memory operations are loads and stores
that are needed to compute the result.  Overhead instruction can be separated
by control-flow instructions and indexing instructions.  

We count these operations per basic block and summarize them in a Summary.
This Summary datastructure keeps track of whether it is based on a condition
and whether it is the true or false branch, the condition it is based on or, if
the basic block is in some loop, how many iterations it is executed.
